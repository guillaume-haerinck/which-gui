# Which GUI ? Microsoft WPF

# TODO Notes

Easy to add simple shapes, but can get really strange with unsuported things (dotted border, and with border radius)

Microsoft blend add margins automatically which can screw up the design

Timeline mode with keyframes usefull but really far from After Effect (copy-paste multiple keyframes, auto-generate keyframes between a beginning and an ending, change timeline cursor to where the mouse is on click). So it is quicker to edit them by hand.

While you can apply css on any html tag, the options are restricted on XAML which can cause a lot of confusion
